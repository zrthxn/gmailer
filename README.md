A lightweight and secure library for easily sending emails using Gmail SMTP servers and a Gmail/GSuite Account. 
This package **does not use Nodemailer** but uses Google APIs. It simplifies the mammoth task of dealing with OAuth2 
and does it in a secure manner. Useful for building servers with mailing features.

**[ THIS PACKAGE IS INCOMPLETE. PLEASE DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION ]**
